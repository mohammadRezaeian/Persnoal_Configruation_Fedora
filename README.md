Hi,

I remember when I was younger, I used to eagerly await the release of the new version of Fedora.
I enjoyed installing them and reporting any problems I encountered.
However, now I use Fedora Kinoite, and I don't need to go through that process anymore.
However, if I ever need to create a virtual Fedora instance, I still use the script for configuring it

**(Please be attentive before using this script; edit it according to your needs.**
**For example, add a bridge or disable it, add any necessary packages, or make any other adjustments as required )**
